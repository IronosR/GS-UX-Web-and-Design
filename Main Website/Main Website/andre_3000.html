                        André 3000 was never a solitary genius. Not when he put on the pith helmet and shoulder pads. 
                        Not when he kicked off a song called “Int’l Players Anthem” with an ode to fidelity and true love. 
                        Not even when he put a dozen versions of himself on stage in the video for “Hey Ya!,” an all-time 
                        classic song that will be played at weddings until the heat death of the universe, and on which he 
                        played nearly every instrument. Even when he sounded like he was rapping from outer space, his 
                        Southern accent dragged him back down to Earth, back to his roots, back to Atlanta, and more 
                        specifically, back to his friends and family. “It gives you an opportunity and support system to 
                        be as free as you can be,” he recently told NPR, reflecting on where he came from and where he 
                        finds himself now, in 2023, a starman in a brand-new galaxy, one dot in a different kind of constellation.

                        So New Blue Sun isn’t really a solo record. It’s also not a bandleader record in the jazz sense, 
                        like Miles Davis’ Kind of Blue or John Coltrane’s A Love Supreme, where the name on the sleeve 
                        indicates the leader in the studio. It’s not the work of one person surrounded by exceptional 
                        musicians to help execute his vision; in that sense, New Blue Sun is even less of a solo record 
                        than The Love Below, André’s half of OutKast’s 2003 double album. On the first full-length release 
                        to bear his name and his name only, André 3000—a man who once christened himself Possum Aloysius 
                        Jenkins, Dookie Blossom Gain III, Funk Crusader, and Love Pusher, all at once—is oftentimes barely 
                        visible. He is a stick of nag champa perfuming the room of this record. He is a happy contributor 
                        to its world, one among many. The man who brought Afrofuturism to TRL has a new trick up his sleeve: 
                        He’s blending in.
                    </p>

                    
                    
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        Like every OutKast record, New Blue Sun is the product of a community. Over the past decade or so, 
                        the worlds of ambient music, electronic music, jazz, beat music, free improv, and new age in Los 
                        Angeles have congealed to create a new and far-reaching style. It encompasses everything from the 
                        DIY dub jazz of Sam Wilkes and Sam Gendel to the harpscapes of Mary Lattimore to the fluid Ethio-
                        funk of Dexter Story. Though there’s no real center to the scene, nearly everyone either has or is 
                        about to work with Carlos Niño—percussionist, producer, founding DJ of the influential internet radio 
                        station Dublab, and connective tissue in a city designed to discourage connection. You’d call him 
                        an instigator if his presence weren’t so gentle. The music he releases under the name Carlos Niño & 
                        Friends is technically complex and spiritually sincere. He invites a few people over, they improvise 
                        freely on whatever instruments are at hand, and Niño then chops, cuts, and shapes the jams into albums 
                        that swell with unspoken but easily understood feelings—André played flute on his album from earlier 
                        this year.
                    </p>

                   

                    <p class="article_main_description">
                    
                        André and Carlos met at Erewhon, the grocery store whose, let’s say, exclusive prices and exceptional 
                        kombucha selection have made it the go-to shop for celebs and a highly memeable avatar of L.A. wellness 
                        culture. Niño invited André to an Alice Coltrane tribute concert he was hosting that evening, and they 
                        started jamming together soon after. Though he’d puffed a tenor sax on The Love Below’s “She Lives in 
                        My Lap,” André was turned on to the true power of woodwinds when he heard champion surfer Kassia Meador 
                        play her flute at a breathwork class in Venice. This is all intensely L.A., nearly to the point of 
                        parody—we haven’t gotten to the song inspired by an ayahuasca therapy session—but it’s also the everyday 
                        reality for plenty of people who live here. When Leaving Records’ Matthewdavid, who plays “mycelium 
                        electronics” on New Blue Sun, talks about how private-press new age music has opened him to more beautiful 
                        possibilities in his life, he means it.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        That heritage means that New Blue Sun might be baffling and disappointing to anyone who didn’t have an 
                        opinion on Online Ceramics’ Alice Coltrane collection. There are, as the warning label on the vinyl 
                        sleeve promises, no bars—not a single word is spoken, sung, or rapped—but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t 
                        have something to say. In spite—or maybe because—of its lack of language, New Blue Sun is the most 
                        emotionally direct music André has ever made. The methods might be oblique, the instrumentation often 
                        unclear, the man himself occasionally missing in action or off on his own pursuits, but the sense of 
                        intermixed sadness, loss, and peace that permeates this music is impossible to miss.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        Together with a core ensemble of guitarist Nate Mercereau and keyboardist Surya Botofasina (both 
                        responsible for some incredible music on their own), André and Niño flood this record with a mood as 
                        blue and deep as the water off Catalina. You can hear it there in the opening moments of “I swear, I 
                        Really Wanted To Make A ‘Rap’ Album But This Is Literally The Way The Wind Blew Me This Time.” It’s in 
                        the clear-eyed regret that comes through Mercereau’s guitar and sticks around as the group begins to 
                        build upon it; it’s the foundation of all eight of these songs.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        André has been playing handmade flutes for years, a devotion that has put his desire for anonymity 
                        in jeopardy. Like John Coltrane, who would invite over a friend and then spend the entire visit working 
                        out new ideas on his sax, André’s devotion to his instrument is nearly compulsive; maybe you saw him 
                        practicing at LAX. So it’s surprising that he recorded much of New Blue Sun with a digital wind 
                        instrument he’d never played before. Like a Fairlight synth set to “strings,” it makes a virtue of 
                        how little it sounds like the instrument it claims to sound like, producing a flat and buzzing tone 
                        that André learns how to manipulate over the course of the record.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        The great Pharoah Sanders, whose influence is felt in the general tone of New Blue Sun more than in 
                        its actual playing, sits out the first five minutes of his classic Tauhid, allowing his band to develop 
                        the mood before he makes his entrance, piccolo in hand. André does the same on New Blue Sun, sitting 
                        back and allowing us to stare into “I swear”’s breezy darkness for three minutes before he picks up 
                        his instrument. The song yips and howls, Niño rattles his signature shells, Botofasina weaves a meshy 
                        wave of synths that swell without breaking. There’s a lot to hear and very little movement; imagine a 
                        spotlit meteorite on display in a gallery, rotating slowly so you have time to take in all its facets. 
                        Now imagine what that would make you think about.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        When André does finally play, he picks his notes carefully, like he’s testing to see where he fits. 
                        The melody he dots out in “I swear” recalls Philip Glass in the nakedness of its notes, or even the 
                        writer Raymond Carver: He’s making simple gestures feel grand by virtue of their accumulation. 
                        Throughout New Blue Sun, this tends to be how he plays his instrument, whether he’s setting the 
                        theme or exploring its variations. The notation is minimal, and he repeats short and uncomfortable 
                        phrases until they begin to sound right: Listen as he dips, brushes, and dabs in “The Slang Word P(*)ssy 
                        Rolls Off The Tongue With Far Better Ease Than The Proper Word Vagina . Do You Agree?,” finally tracing a 
                        few fine, confident lines at the top of the canvas that pull the song into a new mode.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        About those titles: Yes, they are long. They are playful. He misspells Gandhi’s name, yes. There 
                        is something to be said about how André can’t help but use language to both say and obfuscate what 
                        he’s feeling. It’s tempting to map some kind of narrative onto instrumental music, particularly 
                        something as gauzy and obviously personal as this. You can read the beatific sigh of New Blue Sun 
                        as a comment on the relief of anonymity André must feel, or how the safety of a group of like-minded 
                        people allows you to take a closer look at the darkness outside. If you don’t look at the tracklist, 
                        you can do that. But those song titles deflect your gaze, keep you from taking this stuff too 
                        seriously, from reading too much into it. Call it a feint, but it feels like a way of keeping the 
                        music light and exciting, of protecting the exploratory spirit that went into its creation.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        Despite his lyrical virtuosity, André has always sought out what a song needs; consider the way 
                        the back half of “B.O.B” is given over to gospel rave, or how “SpottieOttieDopaliscious”’ ineffable 
                        hook is a wordless trumpet line. Here, he’s doing the same thing, moving carefully and only asserting 
                        himself when it feels right. He tests “The Slang Word” out for vulnerabilities, teasing at its fabric 
                        with his flute, picking lightly lest he rip the seam. Armed with his contrabass flute in “That Night 
                        In Hawaii When I Turned Into A Panther And Started Making These Low Register Purring Tones That I 
                        Couldn’t Control … Sh¥t Was Wild,” he’s much more confident. He slurs like Rahsaan Roland Kirk, tweets 
                        like Eric Dolphy, sets up a melody, then liquidates it and lets it simmer against the muted vibration 
                        of Deantoni Parks’ drum.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        Parks, like the rest of the ensemble, is a full participant in the creation of this music, and 
                        throughout New Blue Sun, the other instrumentalists show off their ability to spontaneously birth 
                        new sounds. In “Ninety Three ’Til Infinity and Beyoncé,” Matthewdavid scrapes and smears crusty 
                        grains of noise thick as wheatpaste across the track and Botofasina brings to mind Laraaji’s Vision 
                        Songs, Vol. 1 with his homey basement organ in “The Slang Word.” Then there’s Diego Gaeta, whose 
                        slowly turning piano runs in “Ghandi, Dalai Lama, Your Lord & Savior J.C. / Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, 
                        And John Wayne Gacy” are the rotator in the gyroscope, a counterweight that keeps everything from 
                        tumbling. He flirts with dreamy realization, pumps a bit of gospel, then slides into a resigned 
                        darkness, barely touching the keys; the way his playing sits like a glass turned over the buzzing 
                        fly of André’s melody brings New Blue Sun closer to the tragic experiments of Tim Hecker’s 
                        Ravedeath, 1972 than jazz or new age.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        Niño is a great architect of audio space, but his touch here is more subtle than it is on his Carlos 
                        Niño & Friends records. He layers carefully, letting you peek through windows into adjacent rooms, 
                        teasing you with the possibility of a party going on but keeping it just out of reach. In the album’s 
                        best song, “BuyPoloDisorder’s Daughter Wears A 3000™ Shirt Embroidered,” he sets his own drums deep in 
                        the distance and cloaks them in mist, then keeps André halfway between the drums and the foreground, 
                        lightly dipping the his flute in distortion. It has the strange effect of making the background of 
                        the song more intriguing than the foreground, a sensation deepened by André’s melody. While Mercereau 
                        and Botofasina lacquer a sexy, tuxedoed duet for guitar and synth in the front of the song only to be 
                        overtaken by a wall of brass, André’s peppy, questioning melody disappears and returns at strange 
                        intervals behind it all, blurring out of view and occasionally getting lost in the noise. Even when 
                        it’s not there, you feel its presence in the haze; like a Magic Eye piece, “BuyPoloDisorder” is a 
                        song whose chaos resolves into unstable patterns over and over again. It’s among the best music anyone 
                        on this record has ever created.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        Still, the instincts of André and Niño, who produced the album together, occasionally get the better 
                        of them. New Blue Sun is patient in a way that Niño’s work often isn’t, and the performances here 
                        develop so slowly they sometimes stall out. The stillness of the scene often aims for the muted drama 
                        of Hiroshi Yoshimura’s environmental music, but on repeated spins its dramatic tension collapses and 
                        can feel tedious at times. On “The Slang Word,” the ensemble struggles to break out of its mutual 
                        deference, and the gentleness of André’s prodding starts to feel like time-killing foot-tapping. When 
                        it does finally break free, letting out slurry little lines before hopping back into a jittery theme, 
                        the song is already beginning its (strangely lengthy) fadeout. This kind of music is built on the 
                        relationship between tone, texture, and personality, and as the pieces begin to dilate, it becomes 
                        harder to track their development; there are no truly dull moments, but there are dull stretches.

                        Asking people who have only ever shaken it like a Polaroid picture to clear their minds for 90 minutes 
                        of spacey new-age music might be a tall order. Even in the context of the world that birthed it, New 
                        Blue Sun is a demanding listen. For all its considerable bright moments, this is a frequently ponderous 
                        record, one that suggests a surprising amount of potential but that still demands a lot even from 
                        seasoned ears. It’s more successful as a symbol than as an album: It can be incredibly moving to witness 
                        one of the most self-assured musicians of all time put himself in vulnerable artistic situations and 
                        enjoy figuring out how to navigate them. Even on his handmade flutes, he never lets out the kind of fluid, 
                        cocksure flow that sold over 25 million records.

                        The album’s greatest triumph, then, is its normalcy. It reveals André 3000 to be nothing more than a 
                        guy with solid taste in outré music, another Angeleno in deceptively expensive workwear who’s probably 
                        been listening to Midori Takada since the YouTube rip. His ability to fit in and play along on New Blue 
                        Sun suggests he could easily spend the next 30 years making insular but genuinely interesting records 
                        for a small pool of devotees, riding off into well-earned obscurity like Laraaji in a Cadillac. Few 
                        stars of his caliber have managed an artistically and personally fulfilling post-fame career without 
                        repudiating what they did to become famous—or, worse, rehashing it. That he’s made such a thing possible 
                        is a significant achievement.
