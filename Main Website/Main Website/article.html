                        On tiptoeing into the hushed atmosphere of The Lodge in The Deaf Institute on Friday night, one thing was
                        immediately
                        clear. Aga Ujma, the musician who was deftly plucking the harp on stage, sounded unmistakably like Björk. I know
                        it’s
                        somewhat reductive to simply say ‘this artist sounds like this other artist’, but it was too uncanny not to mention.
                        In
                        the pitch, accented delivery, and impressive range of her vocals, I was reminded of those early Björk albums which
                        touched on traditional Icelandic folk. Ujma is Polish though, so I hope I’m not stepping on fragile Poland-Iceland
                        relations here. Anyway, it was beautiful. The songs were delicate and peaceful, and the audience observed in total
                        silence. I strongly suspected this was an indication of things to come.

                        I didn’t know much about Hinako Omori. From the little I’d heard, atmospheric and ambient electronic music was her
                        bag,
                        so I approached this evening expecting something mellow. As the lights dimmed, a slight figure draped in grey slowly
                        took to the stage. Speaking incredibly softly, Omori declared herself pleased to be here, and would be playing a few
                        old
                        songs then her new album, Stillness, Softness in full. Compared to the city buzz I’d experienced on my walk here, I
                        admired the stillness Omori had carved out in this space. This was respite from the outside world. A soft directive
                        to
                        lean in and listen.

                        A low electronic tone swelled from the synthesiser in front of her. Blue lights began to glow and pulse slowly. And
                        as
                        Omori began to sing softly, ghostly voices echoed from the speakers in contrast. The effect was ethereal. I felt
                        immersed immediately, and was simultaneously impressed by the crisp sound in this small room.

                        The atmosphere had been set. Quiet, soothing, peaceful. It was therefore unintentionally hilarious when, during a
                        slight
                        transition between songs, the ceiling began to vigorously shake. And not just a bit either: the fixtures and
                        fittings
                        were visibly rocking. Clearly, whatever event was taking place above our heads was more raucous than this one.
                        Collectively, we looked up, and then over at the bar staff who didn’t look unduly concerned. This, concerningly,
                        must
                        happen all the time. Eyes back to the stage then.

                        There’s a tension and release with Hinako Omori’s music. Slow, electronic drones would stretch out for what felt
                        like
                        minutes, before Omori’s voice softly came back into the picture. After the third track, with the lights low, the
                        sound
                        of waves lapped from the speakers. It felt like the aim was to aurally transport us away. The effect was somewhat
                        hypnotic. But then we were brought back into the room as blue lights rose, and high piano notes began to play. We
                        went
                        from the ‘Ocean’ to ‘The Richest Garden In Your Memory’ – both tracks from last year’s A Journey. The set felt
                        meticulously crafted with one song flowing into another. And while music in this genre can feel like one long piece
                        of
                        background music, for me, especially at this early point, it felt wonderfully immersive.
