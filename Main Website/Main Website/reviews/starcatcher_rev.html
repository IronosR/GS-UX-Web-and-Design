                        Greta Van Fleet threads the familiar line between extravagant guitars and crystalline wails on their third album Starcatcher. Their previous album, The Battle At Garden’s Gate, saw the group continue their open love-letter to classic rock, whilst touching upon socially-progressive issues. This time around, Greta Van Fleet does not stray far away from their signature sound. Rather, the group is drawn towards aesthetics, delving deep into the allure of nature, a universe which would come to inhabit Starcatcher. Produced by Dave Cobb, Starcatcher, likens its predecessors, full of unapologetic self-expression and bejewelled jumpsuits.

                        A decade after their conception, it has become difficult to ignore the elephant in the room surrounding Greta Van Fleet. The fact of the matter is that Greta Van Fleet has no distinct sound, which Starcatcher continues to amplify. The music remains emotive and mountainous in scale, as the band champions well-worn traits, making for an overly repetitive record. It gives the impression that rather than evolving sonically, they care more about showcasing their musicianship, which opening track “Fate of The Faithful” showcases. With a blues rock foundation, the track strikes an equilibrium, showcasing the individual members skills, and the band in a stronger position, thematically and sonically. The track sets the musical progression of the record in stone, with little to no variation across the forthcoming tracks.

                        Starcatcher is sharpest when it doesn’t rush into anthemic climax, rather slowly building before reaching its crescendo, as shown on leading single “Meeting the Master”. Undoubtedly Greta Van Fleet’s magnum opus, the track is sung in the voice of a devout believer, and eventual group exclamation, detailing the love the fervent followers have for their teacher. It is a timeless and skin-tingling hymn that immerses the listener into the Starcatcher universe. A focal point of Greta Van Fleet’s musical career is their ability to sonically and lyrically paint up a vivid picture of their albums aesthetics, this time channelling mystical themes and earthy landscapes. In this aspect, Starcatcher lies leagues above its previous records, carrying a sense of commandment similar to how Eno commands ambient music. In other words, Starcatcher invokes a sense of liberty, cruising down highways, just as the sun is about to set.

                        Greta Van Fleet has yet to soar when it comes to their lyrics when compared to their musicality, and Starcatcher is no stranger to. Josh Kizka has a lot of ambitious ideas but it often comes out as word fluff. Despite this, Starcatcher does pack a few lyrical gems, such as “Farewell for Now”. “And I wish we all could stay/But I bid you a farewell/And it means the world to play”, Josh Kizka belts among acoustic guitars and thumping drums, serving as a bittersweet farewell from the band to fans at the end of their concerts. The track sees the singer embrace a sentimental tone in his songwriting as opposed to hiding behind vague metaphors to get his points across, as evident with “Sacred The Thread”. “I’ve caught the wind/In a kite of dreams, in a flight of seams/Like freedom sewn”, which at a deeper glance is a nod to the liberation that authentic self-expression can bring. Lyrics, especially potent given the backlash Greta Van Fleet has received regarding them adorning flamboyant jumpsuits in live performances.

                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        Since they first appeared on the music scene, Greta Van Fleet has unapologetically walked the same path of psychedelic blues rock, with Starcatcher following in their footsteps. Whether it is critic’s speculation or the heights of pressure, Starcatcher is an album not phased by success, instead it’s the product of a band continuing to perfect their craft.

                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        In other words, there’s nothing new under the sun as long as Greta Van Fleet continues to put out new music. It is fair to say that Greta Van Fleet is at their very best when championing what put them on the map: stunning guitar licks, remarkable drum rhythms, groovy bass lines and enticing vocals. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        In an industry that puts pressure on bands to reinvent themselves in order to stay relevant, Greta Van Fleet has managed to defy the odds by staying true to their roots and whilst simultaneously selling out arenas, time and time again, which Starcatcher solidifies.
