                        Veteran filmmaker Yash Chopra has stepped into the director's shoes maybe 
                        for the last time, which makes Jab Tak Hai Jaan a very special movie. With 
                        Shah Rukh Khan, the King of Romance, in the lead, the music raises lot of 
                        expectations. Mozart of Madras AR Rahman has composed eight original tracks 
                        and one reprise version, while Gulzar has penned the lyrics.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        The soundtrack starts off with Challa, a soothing number sung by Rabbi, 
                        which mesmerises you to the core. The sound of guitar and drums coupled with 
                        Rabbi's distinct voice is a total bliss, while the lyrics are easy to the 
                        ears. Musically speaking, it is fine melody and minimal experimentation that 
                        strike the right chord.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        It is followed by Saans, which is like a trademark romantic song, reminiscent
                        of Yash Raj Films. The duet sung by Mohit Chauhan and Shreya Ghoshal is deep 
                        with good use of instruments like flute and violin. But in terms of composition, 
                        Rahman could have produced a better track. It's definitely not the finest from 
                        his ensemble, and fails to impress beyond a point.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                    
                        It also has a slower reprise version, a solo by Shreya Ghoshal. It's not bad but 
                        that's all one can say about it. Ishq Shava is an interesting track that fuses Arabic 
                        and techno sounds combined with the versatile voices of Raghav Mathur and Shlpa Rao. 
                        There is a good use of instruments like the oud, the mandolin and the saz to get the 
                        desired effect. Rahman's melody is a fine listen indeed and peppy beats grow on the 
                        listener.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        Heer crooned by Hrashdeep Kaur recreates the eternal Mirza-Sahiban romance with the 
                        heart wrenching lyrics by Gulzaar. The song is surely the high point of the album and 
                        takes you to the land of Punjab. Rahman has composed a beautiful piece of music that 
                        just bowls you over. Jiya Re is an upbeat song that lifts up your mood with its racy 
                        tune and energetic vocals by Neeti Mohan. The sound is youthful and one appreciates 
                        the interlacing of flute and strings that uplifts the tempo.
                    </p>

                        Next up is the title track Jab Tak Hai Jaan, starts as a slow romantic track with 
                        the voice of Javed Ali, but changes track once the tabla is introduced. Shaktisree 
                        Gopalan enters and after a while but there is just something amiss here. Maybe in a 
                        bid to make it sound different, the composer went a bit haywire here.It's followed 
                        by the instrumental piece Ishq Dance, which reminds you of Dance of Envy from Dil 
                        To Pagal Hai that became quite popular.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        However, in term of music this one is not at par with its predecessor. Rounding up 
                        the album is Jab Tak Hai Jaan Poem penned by Aditya Chopra with a soulful rendition
                        by none other than SRK. It does manage to make way into your heart.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        Overall, the music rides high on romantic flavour and tries to capture different 
                        emotions surrounding love with resounding success. There are some flaws here and 
                        there, but they can be ignored while looking at the larger picture.
