                        As an artist in a genre where emerging stars are rarely old enough to drive, let alone drink, Danny 
                        Brown has always seemed self-conscious about his age. His breakout mixtape, XXX, was titled in part 
                        to reference his age at the time. His next album title was even less subtle. Quaranta—“40” in Italian 
                        but also, a near-homonym for “quarantine”—arrives as Brown enters his fourth decade, and he’s called 
                        it a “spiritual sequel to XXX.” That’s a bit misleading though, because Quaranta is a very different 
                        record. Across a number of solemn, lyric-heavy tracks, Brown catalogs his regrets and owns up to his 
                        personal failings. If XXX felt like a never-ending carousel of sex and drugs, Quaranta feels more 
                        like sitting in a therapist's office processing the fallout from a decade of rockstar living.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        The last few years have given Brown a lot to unpack. A lifelong Detroiter, he relocated to Austin, 
                        Texas following a divorce; earlier this year he got sober after a stint in rehab. He wrote Quaranta 
                        during the initial wave of COVID lockdown and it sounds like it. Brown’s stance is isolated and 
                        reflective; he raps deliberately over sparse beats, his delivery more confessional than flamboyant. 
                        Where his previous albums approached similar topics (Old, in particular, attempted to reconcile 
                        Brown’s hedonistic lifestyle and traumatic childhood), the music and rapping were far more dynamic. 
                        On Quaranta, Brown’s acrobatic flows, ear for oddball beats, and dark sense of humor are in short 
                        supply.

                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        Brown has always been equal parts traditionalist and insurgent. While he led a wave of internet-
                        fluent rappers who crossed over into indie and EDM, his mastery of storytelling and technique 
                        betrayed his love of ’90s hip-hop. He leaned into those sounds on 2019’s uknowhatimsayin¿, which 
                        was executive-produced by Q-Tip, and goes further on Quaranta, often dropping the nasal honk and 
                        frantic delivery in favor of a lower register and slower tempos. He’s never sounded more distant 
                        from the current wave of psychedelic rap he influenced, a fact that’s equally evident in his 
                        lyrics. The subject matter here is heavy and personal, even by Danny Brown standards—few rappers 
                        have aired out this sort of dirty laundry on record. “Down Wit It” delves into heartbreak and 
                        addiction (“Now it’s all over, can’t stay sober/Deep in my depression, hoping I can get over”) 
                        while “Quaranta'” undercuts Brown’s image with a grim dose of reality: “Lost everything in 
                        pursuit of my dream/Pushed everyone away, now no one here but me.”
                    </p>

                   

                    <p class="article_main_description">
                    
                        It’s commendable that Brown would rather make an album about what he’s going through 
                        than cater to what his audience expects—as he told us a decade ago, he has no intention 
                        of rapping about youthful exploits for the rest of his life. That said, Quaranta often 
                        fails to present these topics in compelling ways. On the more diaristic songs, the narratives 
                        aren’t as vivid, the rapping isn’t as nimble, and the songs lack momentum. It’s telling that on 
                        “Celibate,” the otherwise sedate MIKE easily scores the album’s best verse by injecting some 
                        verve into a song that’s otherwise inert. Brown attempts to widen his focus on “Jenn’s Terrific 
                        Vacation,” which enlists Kassa Overall for a drum-fill-heavy, Goodie Mob-referencing song about 
                        gentrification in Detroit. But the observations feel surface-level and pat (someone, please 
                        write a song about gentrification without mentioning Whole Foods). The subject matter lands 
                        just outside of Brown’s wheelhouse, and despite rapping in the first-person, he struggles to 
                        bring his usual color to the storytelling.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        Not everything on Quaranta feels like a break from the past—there are a few glimpses of 
                        Brown’s old charisma. The proggy, Alchemist-produced lead single “Tantor” falls into a 
                        familiar trap: In picking something challenging to rap over, Brown ends up with a beat 
                        that feels clunky. Still, he manages to straddle the line, as he often has, between woke 
                        and gleefully ignorant (“It’s that Black Lives Matter, still sniff cocaine”). The beat 
                        for “Y.B.P” is a bit goofy and brings to mind early Insane Clown Posse but, as Brown knows 
                        well, ICP is a Detroit institution. The song is glowing with the personality and local 
                        color that’s missing from many of these songs (Bruiser Wolf hilariously sums up the state 
                        of Michigan thusly: “It’s hard to fit in the murder mitten like O.J.’s glove”). “Dark 
                        Sword Angel” is Quaranta’s best song and the only track that could easily slot into a noisy, 
                        industrial album like Atrocity Exhibition. Over a squelchy instrumental buttressed by live 
                        drums, Brown drops the sort of filthy punchlines he’s long been known for (“Tried to put my 
                        finger in her like a rotary phone/If I take her for a spin, she will never call home”). The 
                        song provides a much-needed jolt of energy and humor to an album that’s lacking in both.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="article_main_description">
                        On Quaranta, Danny Brown seems to be questioning his choices while plotting a path forward. 
                        And though it’s more compelling in theory than in practice, its meditative tone is a bold 
                        move coming from an artist known for giddy hedonism. Whether spending $70,000 on samples, 
                        dropping a heater with Purity Ring, or touring with Kitty, Brown has never been one to make 
                        safe choices and few rappers with his stellar track record would throw a curveball like this 
                        a decade into their career. There are a few hints that this experimentation might yet bear 
                        fruit, like the serene closing track, “Bass Jam,” where he sounds open-hearted and nostalgic. 
                        But those bright spots aren’t enough to lift the album out of its dour funk. Growth can be 
                        awkward, and for better or worse, Quaranta feels like an apt reflection of this process. 
                        Given how few rappers are given the opportunity to age gracefully, it still feels like a 
                        privilege to hear him work through it.
